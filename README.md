# EDA on DNA Methylation
This is a private repository dedicated to various data anlysis tasks related to DNA methylation, under James Walker's supervision, Ecker Lab. There will (estimated) be four parts to this repository: 

- Nanopore genome sequencing data for 5mC and 6mA
- Processing Single Nucleus Methylatyed Cytosine and Transcriptome (snmCT) seqencing data via Yet Another Pipeline ([YAP](https://hq-1.gitbook.io/mc/))
- Creating a heatmap of expression (and optimizing performance) for groups of genes.
- Gene methylation / RNA correlation analysis from ore-existing scripts.

Within each task folder, there will be a rough overview of the task, tools or pipelines necessary, and raw data required to perform analysis and plotting.
