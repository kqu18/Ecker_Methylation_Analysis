# DMR pipeline manual
this markdown will serve as the tutorial for the DMR analysis after curating the gff files via steps from `allcools_pipeline.md`. This pipeline attempts to:
- merge gff files in to a dataframe
- annotate euc/het gene/TE regions
- perform EDA
- calculate custom χ² test statistic for generating individual DMWs and "chunks" of DMRs
